 *
 * @brief Launching Jobs with Job Control in a Shell.
 * @link<https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Launching-Jobs.html>
 *
 * Once the shell assumes responsibility for job control on its controlling terminal,
 * it can initiate jobs in response to user commands.
 *
 * @par Process Creation with fork and exec
 * Processes in a process group are created using fork and exec functions. Care must be taken
 * due to multiple child processes, ensuring the correct order to avoid race conditions.
 *
 * @par Parent-Child Relationship Structure
 * Two options exist for structuring the parent-child relationships among processes:
 * all processes in the group as children of the shell or one process as the ancestor of others.
 * The former is simpler for bookkeeping.
 *
 * @par setpgid Function
 * Each process, when forked, should place itself in the new process group using the setpgid function.
 * The first process becomes the group leader, and its ID becomes the group ID.
 *
 * @par Timing Considerations
 * To address potential timing issues, the shell and each child process should call setpgid.
 * This ensures that all child processes are in the group before execution begins,
 * regardless of which process calls setpgid first.
 *
 * @par Foreground Job Handling
 * For foreground jobs, the new process group needs to be set as the foreground on the controlling terminal
 * using tcsetpgrp. Both the shell and its child processes should perform this to avoid race conditions.
 *
 * @par Signal Actions Resetting
 * Child processes should reset their signal actions. The shell, during initialization,
 * sets itself to ignore job control signals. Child processes should explicitly set signal actions back to SIG_DFL
 * after forking.
 *
 * @par Handling Stop Signals
 * Applications inheriting signal handling from the parent (shell) should not interfere with stop signals.
 * If applications disable normal interpretation of certain characters, they should provide an alternative mechanism
 * for the user to stop the job.
 *
 * @par exec Function Call
 * Each child process should call exec in the standard way. This is also the point for handling redirection
 * of standard input and output channels.
 *
 * @par Sample Shell Function
 * The provided shell program includes a function responsible for launching a program. This function is executed
 * by each child process immediately after being forked by the shell and does not return.

/**
 * @brief Handling Foreground Job Launch in the Shell.
 *
 * This section discusses the actions taken by the shell when launching a job into the foreground
 * and highlights the differences compared to launching a background job.
 *
 * @par Foreground Job Launch Steps:
 * - The shell grants access to the controlling terminal for the foreground job by calling tcsetpgrp.
 * - The shell then waits for processes in the newly created process group to terminate or stop.
 *   See Stopped and Terminated Jobs for more details.
 * - Once all processes in the group have completed or stopped, the shell regains control of the
 *   terminal for its own process group by calling tcsetpgrp again.
 *
 * @par Stop Signal Handling:
 * - Stop signals caused by I/O from a background process or a SUSP character typed by the user
 *   are sent to the process group. Normally, all processes in the job stop together.
 *
 * @par Terminal State Restoration:
 * - The foreground job may leave the terminal in an altered state, so the shell restores its own
 *   saved terminal modes before proceeding.
 * - In the event the job is merely stopped, the shell first saves the current terminal modes to
 *   facilitate restoration if the job is later continued.
 * - Terminal mode functions tcgetattr and tcsetattr are used for dealing with terminal modes;
 *   refer to Terminal Modes for more information.

 * and continue to read commands from the terminal.

 * - In the sample shell, transitioning a job to the background requires minimal actions.
 *
 * @par Background Job Function:

/**
 * @brief Handling Process Status in a Shell.
 *
 * When a foreground process is launched, the shell blocks until all processes in that job
 * have either terminated or stopped. The waitpid function with the WUNTRACED option is used
 * to achieve this, reporting status for both stopping and terminating processes.
 *
 * The shell also checks the status of background jobs to report terminated and stopped jobs
 * to the user. This is done by calling waitpid with the WNOHANG option, often placed just
 * before prompting for a new command.
 *
 * Asynchronous notification of available status information for a child process can be received
 * by establishing a handler for SIGCHLD signals, as detailed in Signal Handling.
 *
 * In the sample shell program, the SIGCHLD signal is typically ignored to avoid reentrancy issues
 * with global data structures. However, during specific times, such as when waiting for input
 * on the terminal, it makes sense to enable a handler for SIGCHLD. The same function
 * (do_job_notification) used for synchronous status checks can also be called from within this handler.
 *
 * Here are the relevant parts of the sample shell program dealing with checking the status of jobs
 * and reporting the information to the user.
